Small project that uses the Tatoeba API for generating "fill-in-the-blank" sentences :)

Made with the Deno based framework Fresh.

### Running the project locally

Make sure to install Deno: https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation

Then start the project:

```
deno task start
```

This will watch the project directory and restart as necessary.
